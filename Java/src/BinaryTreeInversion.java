You are given the root of a binary tree. Invert the binary tree in place.
That is, all left children should become right children, and all right children should become left children.
Example:

    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \  /
d   e f

The inverted version of this tree is as follows:
  a
 / \
 c  b
 \  / \
  f e  d
